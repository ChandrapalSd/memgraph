# WARNING: do not run this script without defining THREADS!
# If THREADS isn't defined then this script will call 'make -j'.
# From the manpage: "If the  -j  option is given without an argument, make will not limit the number of jobs that can run simultaneously."
# That means that the whole build will be started simultaneously and IT WILL CRASH YOUR COMPUTER!
