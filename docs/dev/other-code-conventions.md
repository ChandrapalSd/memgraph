# Other Code Conventions

While we are mainly programming in C++, we do use other programming languages
when appropriate. This chapter describes conventions for such code.

## Python

Code written in Python should adhere to
[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). You should run `flake8` on
your code to automatically check compliance.

## Common Lisp

Code written in Common Lisp should adhere to
[Google Common Lisp Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/lispguide.xml).
